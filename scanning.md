##### 1.2.63 (U) Demonstrate scanning a target to identify all open ports of interest

# Port Scanning with `nmap` (network mapper)




# all about `nmap`

- to demonstrate port scanning, I used `nmap`
- `nmap` or network mapper is an open source tool for network exploration and security auditing
- it is designed to rapidly scan large networks or individual hosts


### `nmap` output

- typical `nmap` output will look something like the block below:
```

< INSERT LATER >

```

### Syntax Builder
`nmap [ <Scan Type> ...] [ <Options> ] { <target specification> }`
 - note: entire networks OR individual hosts can be scanned within the target specification

# Demo

- For my demonstration of portscanning I set up a Ubuntu 22.04 machine scanning a Windows 10 Home machine for ports of interest. I demonstrated various scans you can perform using nmap, including a XMAS tree scan, a TCP half-open scan, and various speeds of scanning. Additonally, I scanned the entire network to show `nmap`'s functionality for scanning entire networks over individual boxes.
