##### 1.2.63 (U) Demonstrate scanning a target to identify all open ports of interest


# Demo

- For my demonstration of portscanning I set up a Ubuntu 22.04 machine scanning a Windows 10 Home machine for ports of interest. I demonstrated various scans you can perform using nmap, including a XMAS tree scan, a TCP half-open scan, and various speeds of scanning. Additonally, I scanned the entire network to show `nmap`'s functionality for scanning entire networks over individual boxes.

- ports I opened: `10000-10100, 21, 22, 23, 443, 64000-64500, 143, 80, 8080, 2222`
